###📂 pset0/playback

This folder contains my solution for **Problem Set 0: Playback** from the CS50 Introduction to Python Programming course.

#### 🎯 Problem Description:
The goal of this exercise is to write a Python program that takes user input and converts spaces in the input into `...` (three dots). This simulates a playback effect, similar to how a digital assistant like Siri might pause between words.

#### 🛠️ Key Concepts:
- Taking user input using `input()`
- String manipulation in Python
- Using the `replace()` method to substitute characters or strings

#### 📄 Solution Overview:
The solution involves:
1. Prompting the user to input a string.
2. Replacing all spaces (`" "`) in the string with `...` using the `replace()` method.
3. Printing the modified string back to the user.
